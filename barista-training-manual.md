## What is coffee <!--Add isolated image of coffee plant diagram-->
Coffee comes from seeds found within the cherries of a **coffea** plant.

<!--Add isolated image titled "Diagram of coffee plant anatomy" here-->

Coffea plants come in different species and varietals, each which produce coffee with unique sensory characteristics. To learn more about coffea plants, see <a href="#species-and-varietals">species and varietals</a> in the further reading section.  

Because coffea plants thrive in tropical climates, most coffee is grown in a ring of regions near the equator called the *coffee belt*. Each of the places within the coffee belt also affect the way coffee tastes, which is why coffee named after its origin. For more information about <a href="#countries-and-regions">countries and regions</a>, see the further reading section.

1. Picking 
2. Processing 
3. Roasting
