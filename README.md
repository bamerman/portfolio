# Note to the reader 
Thank you for taking the time to look through my portfolio repository, which contains technical writing samples created for Amruta Ramade's [Technical Writing Workshop](https://www.techwritingacademy.com/). For the workshop, I learned GitHub and wrote these technical documents based on my experience: 

- **Getting started with your GitHub profile README** is a tutorial that guides new GitHub users through creating a GitHub profile README. 

- **How to add a file to your GitHub repository** is a how-to guide that shows GitHub users how to add a file to a GitHub repository.

- **GitHub UI reference guide** is a reference guide that documents the main GitHub UI features. 

- **Why you should host your technical writing portfolio on GitHub** is an explainer doc that describes the benefits of hosting your technical writing portfolio on GitHub.
