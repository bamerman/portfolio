# Why you should host your technical writing portfolio on GitHub 
The technical writing profession has changed dramatically over the past decade, but technical writing portfolios haven't. Traditionally, technical writers have maintained portfolios by saving copies of their work or hosting it on a website. These customs have remained largely unchallenged, despite technical writing being more digital and collaborative than ever. 

GitHub can adapt your portfolio to the demands of today's technical writing profession. GitHub's success rests on the following attributes: 
- Community 
- Opportunity 
- Discovery 

These attributes have helped millions of programmers collaborate on today's most influential software projects. These attributes can also modernize your technical writing portfolio.
