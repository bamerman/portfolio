## Audience 
This tutorial is for new GitHub users. If you are familiar with creating a profile README, skip to the [Further Reading] (#further-reading) section at the end of this page.

## Goal 
In this tutorial, you will create a GitHub profile README file. A GitHub profile README is equal to an About Me page. 

## Five Steps 
### 1. Create A Repository
After signing into your GitHub account, click on the <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> icon at the top right of the GitHub webpage. Choose **New repository** from the dropdown menu. If you haven't created your GitHub account, you can learn how to do so [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).
> :bulb: **_Tip:_** The dropdown menu will only appear when your browser is on full screen. This tutorial recommends that you continue with your browser window fully extended.

### 2. Name Your Repository  
Under **Repository name**, write your username exactly as it appears under **owner**. Optionally, add a **description**. 
> :warning: **_Warning:_** If **Repository name** differs from **owner**, your repository will not contain a public README profile.)

### 3. Publicize Your Repository
Make your repository public by choosing the **Public** option.

### 4. Add a README File   
Choose the **Add a README file** field. 

### 5. Create Your README File
Finally, click **Create repository**. 

## You Did It!  
Congratulations! You've successfully created a GitHub profile README. Personalize your profile by clicking **Edit README**. Have fun telling the GitHub Community about yourself!
